Use mern instead of mern 2.
You will need two terminals in vscode. 
One will run the server side and the other will run the client side. 
In one terminal cd into mern then cd into client, then do npm start. This will run the react app. 
In the other terminal cd into mern then cd into server. Do npm start and this will run the server app. 
locahost3000 is where the react app is located. localhost5000 is where the server app us located.
I use the connect your applicaton option on mongoDB. My MongoDb connection is in server/config.env file. then there
us server.js which usees that config.ev file to connect to the database.
This should be all to run the the app in vscode.
I tried to deploy my app into digital ocean but i couldn't get it working.
